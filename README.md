# Income-Prediction

"Welcome to the repository for income prediction models! A machine learning model used in this project predicts people's income levels using a variety of demographic and economic data. It is implemented in Python and scikit-learn, and for high accuracy, it uses a XG Boost algorithm.

# Algorithms Used For Prediction:

XGBoosting Accuracy 
Logistic Regression
k-Nearest Neighbors 
Naive Bayes          
Support Vector Machine

Out of all the above algorithms XG Boost gives the high accuracy for prediction.

# Installation:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment.
3. Install the required dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
